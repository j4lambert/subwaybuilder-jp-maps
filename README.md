# Summary

Each map is limited to the metropolitan area (都市圏) around one or more major Japanese cities. Metropolitan area bounds are taken from the 2015 (csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 大都市雇用圏 dataset, with updates to ensure present-day administrative borders are honored

## Features

- High level of detail, with sub-250m population placements in dense areas.
- Spatial realism -- points are assigned in a manner that is aware of water features and mesh-weighted
- Special demand from several sources is also modeled
  - Airports (based on annual passenger statistics, split by international and domestic travellers)
  - Ports (based on annual passenger statistics)
  - Hospitals (based on reported bed capacity)
  - Students in primary education (小学校・中学校) (clipped to school districts)
  - Students in secondary education (高等学校) (sized by overall municipal enrollment)
  - Students in post-secondary (大学・短期大学) (sized by real enrollment figures)
- OSRM routing included
- Building depth is default to -10m, with train-related infrastructure exempt

## High-Level Methodology

Resident + Commuter totals are approximated using employed persons / workers (就業者数・従業者数) counts per (小地域) augmented by 500m (labor) and 250/100m (resident + approximate population) meshes to achieve sub-小地域 level point placement. Population counts by 小地域 are conserved, and point balancing is done through a mesh (population/worker) aware loss function

Gravity model is augmented by known O/D commute patterns by designated city ward (区) or municipality (市町村) to realistically simulate macro-level commute data in the absence of true O/D pairs

# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-22)

### New Cities

- `ITM` - 大阪 / Ōsaka
- `OKJ` - 岡山 / Okayama

### New Features

- Added demand for ~110 universities/technical colleges with no matching enrollment data (totalling ~140k students)
- Added demand for ~70 aquariums / zoos / botanical gardens

### Other Updates

- Rebalanced overall population to be logarithmic mean of (employed persons / workers) for consistency
  - Most cities should see a ~5-10% increase in total population as a result
- Rebalanced min/max demand totals for individual points based on overall metropolitan area size
  - Smaller, less dense metropolitan areas (e.g. 山形・函館・高知) will see greater point density as a result
  - Larger, already dense metropolitan areas (e.g. 神戸・福岡) should see very little change
- Point seeding algorithm now takes into account 100m mesh population estimates to avoid placing resident point in areas with no buildings
  - Most apparent in highly rural areas of the map
- Added final point/displacement/agglomeration algorithm to reduce very dense point spacing in urban centers

### Bugfixes

- Removed fixed-order origin point assignment in O/D calculation assignment causing significant "skew" in municipality origins for large destination points
  - This fix also signifcantly reduces the share of municipal O/D misalignment going to the smallest municipalities

## 0.2.0 (2026-03-15)

### New Cities

- `HKD` - 函館 / Hakodate
- `IZO` - 中海 / Nakaumi (出雲 (Izumo)・松江 (Matsue)・米子 (Yonago))
- `NGS` - 長崎 / Nagasaki
- `TAK` - 高松 / Takamatsu
- `TOY` - 富山 / Toyama

### New Features

- Added demand from ports / hospitals
- Rebalancing patch across all existing special demand types
  - Airports / Universities / High Schools get significant haircuts on overall demand
- Added padding around boundary so that there is a larger buffer between coastline and black tiles

### Bugfixes

- Fixed elementary/middle school demand being based (inadvertently) off of municipal class count fallback
  - Demand now relies on much more accurate estimate based off of 15歳未満 (under-15) totals per municipality
- Fixed the map for 神戸 (Kobe) missing building depth

## 0.1.3 (2026-03-09)

### New Cities

- `KCZ` - 高知 / Kōchi
- `KIJ` - 新潟 / Niigata
- `KKJ` - 北九州 / Kitakyūshū
- `OKA` - 沖縄 / Okinawa
- `UKY` - 京都 / Kyōto

### New Features

- Added neighborhood/city labels.

## 0.1.2 (2026-03-08)

### New Features

- Added special demand from primary/secondary age students commuting to school.

## 0.1.1 (2026-03-07)

### Initial Cities

- `FUK` - 福岡 / Fukuoka
- `GAJ` - 山形 / Yamagata
- `HIJ` - 広島 / Hiroshima
- `KOJ` - 鹿児島 / Kagoshima
- `MYJ` - 松山 / Matsuyama
- `SDJ` - 仙台 / Sendai
- `SPK` - 札幌 / Sapporo
- `UKB` - 神戸 / Kōbe

### Known Issues

- 鹿児島 (Kagoshima) has park data encoded within the ocean due to the national park surrounding 桜島 (Sakurajima).
- 広島 (Hiroshima) has an improbably tall building -- OSM error
- 富山 (Toyama) has a very isolated point deep in the mountains -- algorithm quirk

# Planned Updates

- Post-processing of large buildings files to enable (hopefully) larger maps (esp. Nagoya)
  - Better building foundation depth estimation (based on OSM building size)
- Reconciliation of 小地域 (small boundary area) job counts vs. 500m job mesh to reduce outliers (e.g. high concentration of workers near a certain set of rice fields)
- Add demand for other cultural institutions (UNESCO world heritage sites / museums / libraries)
- Add demand for event venues (particularly stadiums & arenas)
