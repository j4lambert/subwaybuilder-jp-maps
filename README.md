# Summary

Each map is limited to the metropolitan area (都市圏) around one or more major Japanese cities. Metropolitan area bounds are taken from the 2015 (csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 大都市雇用圏 dataset, with updates to ensure present-day administrative borders are honored

## Features

- High level of detail, with sub-250m population placements in dense areas.
- Spatial realism -- points are assigned in a manner that is aware of water features and mesh-weighted
- Special demand from several sources is also modeled
  - **Airports**
    - Demand based on annualized passenger statistics, split by international & national travelers
  - **Ports**
    - Demand based on annualized passenger statistics
  - **Hospitals**
    - Demand based on heuristic of reported bed capacity and known prefectural inpatient bed usage and outpatient visitation rates
  - **Institutions of Learning**
    - Students in primary education (小学校・中学校) (clipped to school districts)
    - Students in secondary education (高等学校) (sized by overall municipal enrollment)
    - Students in post-secondary (大学・短期大学) (sized by real enrollment figures)
  - **Cultural Attractions**
    - Attendance figures + candidate institutions sourced from prefectural/municipal reports (e.g. [山口県の宿泊者及び観光客の動向](https://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/uploaded/life/217842_497518_misc.pdf))
    - Zoos / Botanical Gardens / Aquariums (動物園・植物園・水族館)
    - Art & History Museums (美術館・博物館)
    - Parks / Sports Facilities / Stadiums (公園・運動公園・総合運動公園・スタジアム・競技場)
    - Major shrines/temples + landmarks (神社・寺・世界遺産・国宝)
- OSRM routing included
- Building depth is default to -10m, with train-related infrastructure exempt

## High-Level Methodology

Resident + Commuter totals are approximated using employed persons / workers (就業者数・従業者数) counts per (小地域) augmented by 500m (labor) and 250/100m (resident + approximate population) meshes to achieve sub-小地域 level point placement. Population counts by 小地域 are conserved, and point balancing is done through a mesh (population/worker) aware loss function

Gravity model is augmented by known O/D commute patterns by designated city ward (区) or municipality (市町村) to realistically simulate macro-level commute data in the absence of true O/D pairs

# Changelog

## 0.3.7 (2026-04-17)

### Major Map Updates

- `MYJ` - 松山 (Matsuyama)
- `OKA` - 沖縄 (Okinawa)
- `SPK` - 札幌 (Sapporo)
- `UKY` - 京都 (Kyōto)

### New Features

- FAll updated maps received significant reworks to include:
  - Attractions-based demand (~3-7% of total demand)
  - Bathymetric data from J-EGG500 + MSIL as well
  - Neighborhood labels
  - Overture sourced buildings
- SPK (札幌) updated to extend southeast to 苫小牧 (Tomakomai) as well as northeast to 岩見沢 (Iwamizawa)
- Initial point seeding is made aware of cross-町丁 points
  - Additional point repulsion pass added at this part of the pipeline which should reduce crowding in dense areas (e.g. 福岡 (Fukuoka) center)
- Point seeding is also aware of elongated 町丁 shapes.
  - 町丁 with high aspect ratios are now force seeded with multiple points so that individual points do not represent extreme spatial distance

### Other Updates

- Fixed designated city ward mapping to be consistent with other municipal labels (e.g. 神戸市中央区|Kōbeshichūōku => 中央区｜Chūō-Ku)

## 0.3.2 (2026-03-27)

### New Cities

- `NGO` - 名古屋 / Nagoya

### Other Updates

- Demand data post-processing made more aggressive (reducing precision to reduce overall data size).
  - As a result 大阪 / Ōsaka should also be even less demanding on the game.

## 0.3.1 (2026-03-25)

### New Features

- Buildings index for 大阪 / Ōsaka significantly reduced to improve playability / renderer OOM crashes.
  - Renderer now crashes with exit code `0x8B1D` which suggests playing the map with GPU rasterization off will help improve stability

### Other Updates

- Updating building processing filter to more aggressively prune small buildings with multiple polygons

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-22)

### New Cities

- `ITM` - 大阪 / Ōsaka
- `OKJ` - 岡山 / Okayama

### New Features

- Added demand for ~110 universities/technical colleges with no matching enrollment data (totalling ~140k students)
- Added demand for ~70 aquariums / zoos / botanical gardens

### Other Updates

- Rebalanced overall population to be logarithmic mean of (employed persons / workers) for consistency
  - Most cities should see a ~5-10% increase in total population as a result
- Rebalanced min/max demand totals for individual points based on overall metropolitan area size
  - Smaller, less dense metropolitan areas (e.g. 山形・函館・高知) will see greater point density as a result
  - Larger, already dense metropolitan areas (e.g. 神戸・福岡) should see very little change
- Point seeding algorithm now takes into account 100m mesh population estimates to avoid placing resident point in areas with no buildings
  - Most apparent in highly rural areas of the map
- Added final point/displacement/agglomeration algorithm to reduce very dense point spacing in urban centers

### Bugfixes

- Removed fixed-order origin point assignment in O/D calculation assignment causing significant "skew" in municipality origins for large destination points
  - This fix also signifcantly reduces the share of municipal O/D misalignment going to the smallest municipalities

### Images

- `TAK` - 高松 / Takamatsu
- `TOY` - 富山 / Toyama

### New Features

- Added demand from ports / hospitals
- Rebalancing patch across all existing special demand types
  - Airports / Universities / High Schools get significant haircuts on overall demand
- Added padding around boundary so that there is a larger buffer between coastline and black tiles

### Bugfixes

- Fixed elementary/middle school demand being based (inadvertently) off of municipal class count fallback
  - Demand now relies on much more accurate estimate based off of 15歳未満 (under-15) totals per municipality
- Fixed the map for 神戸 (Kobe) missing building depth

## 0.1.3 (2026-03-09)

### New Cities

- `KCZ` - 高知 / Kōchi

# Planned Updates
