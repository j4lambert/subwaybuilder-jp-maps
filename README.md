# Summary

Each map is limited to the metropolitan area (都市圏) around one or more major Japanese cities. Metropolitan area bounds are taken from the 2015 (csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp) 大都市雇用圏 dataset, with updates to ensure present-day administrative borders are honored

## Features

- High level of detail, with sub-250m population placements in dense areas.
- Spatial realism -- points are assigned in a manner that is aware of water features and mesh-weighted
- Special demand from several sources is also modeled
  - Airports (based on annual passenger statistics, split by international and domestic travellers)
  - Ports (based on annual passenger statistics)
  - Hospitals (based on reported bed capacity)
  - Students in primary education (小学校・中学校) (clipped to school districts)
  - Students in secondary education (高等学校) (sized by overall municipal enrollment)
  - Students in post-secondary (大学・短期大学) (sized by real enrollment figures)
- OSRM routing included
- Building depth is default to -10m, with train-related infrastructure exempt

## High-Level Methodology

Resident + Commuter totals are approximated using employed persons / workers (就業者数・従業者数) counts per (小地域) augmented by 500m (labor) and 250/100m (resident + approximate population) meshes to achieve sub-小地域 level point placement. Population counts by 小地域 are conserved, and point balancing is done through a mesh (population/worker) aware loss function

Gravity model is augmented by known O/D commute patterns by designated city ward (区) or municipality (市町村) to realistically simulate macro-level commute data in the absence of true O/D pairs

# Planned Updates

- Rebalancing of municipality O/D fit to better handle cities/wards with extreme resident/worker imbalance (e.g. designated city centers)
- Cultural special demand (e.g. museums/libraries/aquariums/etc.) to simulate more leisure travel
- Better post-processing of large buildings files to enable (hopefully) larger maps
